# LBN Competitive System Simulation

"Hey! What if we make 'Golf with your friends' into a LBN competitive system?"
"Are you too bored or what, besides, how the heck do we do that?"

"I dunno, maybe create another user interface for it?"
"Don't tell me you're gonna use tkinter again..."

"Well, not this time!"

✎ Man, the last user to implement.

✎ Can I just speedrun all of that?

✎ Players can be league owners, but league owners are not necessarily players.

✎ I do not want to see any more fatal errors...

Contributors:
	Currently None

To-do list:

	✧ Make league and users actually connected 'pogs'?
 
	✧ Final optimization on most of the form.

	✧ Make the codes much more cleaner (Working on it)
 
	✧ Perhaps adding some SFXs? (Is that even possible?)

Preserved for future check: git 3 steps
1. ```git add .```
2. ```git git commit -m "commit message"```
3. ```git push```
