# LBN Competitive System Simulation

"Hey! What if we make 'Golf with your friends' into a LBN competitive system?"
"Are you too bored or what, besides, how the heck do we do that?"

"I dunno, maybe create another user interface for it?"
"Don't tell me you're gonna use tkinter again..."

"Well, not this time!"

✎ More graphics! More!

✎ Different color theme for different types of users

✎ Dashboards for admins, league owners and players

✎ Consider adding some more easter eggs?

To-do list:

	✧ Admin login and their dashboard Page
 
	✧ Backend login interface

	✧ Make the codes much more cleaner
 
	✧ Perhaps adding some SFXs?

Preserved for future check: git 3 steps
1. ```git add .```
2. ```git git commit -m "commit message"```
3. ```git push```
