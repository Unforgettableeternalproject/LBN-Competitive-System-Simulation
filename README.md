# LBN Competitive System Simulation

"Hey! What if we make 'Golf with your friends' into a LBN competitive system?"
"Are you too bored or what, besides, how the heck do we do that?"

"I dunno, maybe create another user interface for it?"
"Don't tell me you're gonna use tkinter again..."

"Well, not this time!"

✎ Consider adding a database?

✎ There will be more branching screens 

✎ Dashboards for admins and league owners and players

✎ Infrastructure for advertisers...?
