# LBN Competitive System Simulation

"Hey! What if we make 'Golf with your friends' into a LBN competitive system?"
"Are you too bored or what, besides, how the heck do we do that?"

"I dunno, maybe create another user interface for it?"
"Don't tell me you're gonna use tkinter again..."

"Well, not this time!"

✎ Guess what? Unit Test time! (Who tf does unit test at the very end of a project)

To-do list:

	✧ Make the codes much more cleaner (Working on it)
 
	✧ Perhaps adding some SFXs? (Is that even possible?)

	✧ Every user needs their requirements to be tested

	✧ There got to be more improvements

Preserved for future check: git 3 steps
1. ```git add .```
2. ```git git commit -m "commit message"```
3. ```git push```
