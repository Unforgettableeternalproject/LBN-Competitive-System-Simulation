# LBN Competitive System Simulation

"Hey! What if we make 'Golf with your friends' into a LBN competitive system?"
"Are you too bored or what, besides, how the heck do we do that?"

"I dunno, maybe create another user interface for it?"
"Don't tell me you're gonna use tkinter again..."

"Well, not this time!"

✎ Why is admin page so hard to make

✎ Now the chatroom template is done, everything will be fine

✎ Dashboards league owners and players, especailly the later one

✎ Consider adding some more easter eggs? Uh, Not now I guess

Contributors:
	Currently None

To-do list:

	✧ Players...Well I have bad feeling about this
 
	✧ We can do league owners at the same time, absolutely

	✧ Make the codes much more cleaner
 
	✧ Perhaps adding some SFXs?

Preserved for future check: git 3 steps
1. ```git add .```
2. ```git git commit -m "commit message"```
3. ```git push```
